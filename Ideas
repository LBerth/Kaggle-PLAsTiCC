15th class = Class of object not observed
=> Maybe set a threshold : if every probability is under X -> class 15 ?
=> Or maybe a confidence value : is there specific algorithms that outputs a confidence value ?

Remove Spectroscopy

Remove DDF ?
Or separated algorithm ?


+ probability or hot-vector ?
+ with 15th class or without ?
